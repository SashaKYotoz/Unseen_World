# About:

"Unseen World" - dimension-adding Minecraft mod for Forge(and NeoForge in future),that shows dark version of Minecraft's
overworld, where sun never rises.

Chimeric Darkness - mod's dimension, where water is dark, and hazards is everywhere, but even here you can find friends
and a _bunch of adventures on your head_
